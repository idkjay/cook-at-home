## Reflection

  - Cook at Home is a side project created to practice using RESTful API's and CSS. Other project goals included using and refreshing myself on technologies learned up at a full stack web development bootcamp I recently graduated and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features. I wanted to create an app that would be useful during pandemic. As we practice social distancing in 2020, it's important to not go out as much as you usually do for grocery shopping and/or eating out. This app will help users find recipes based off food and ingredients they already have in their pantry and/or fridge.
  
  - One of the main challenges I ran into was working with the API calls. Working with what the data provided me and breaking deeper into what the API offered me took a little more time than I expected. It also took a lot of time setting up Travis-CI in my project with the intent of using it to test and autodeploy my code.
  
  - At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Travis-CI, VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS.
